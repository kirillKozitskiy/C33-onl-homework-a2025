lines
Line 1: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
Line 2: Coral is far more red than her lips red.
Line 3: If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun,
Line 4: If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
Line 5: I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
Line 6: But no such roses see I in her cheeks.
Line 7: And in some perfumes is there more delight
Line 8: Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
Line 9: I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
Line 10: That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
Line 11: I grant I never saw a goddess go,
Line 12: My mistress when she walks, treads on the ground.
Line 13: And yet, by Heaven, I think my love as rare
Line 14: As any she belied with false compare.
